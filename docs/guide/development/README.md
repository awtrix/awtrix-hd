## Awtrix HD Development

The development ecosystem of Awtrix HD has improved substantially over previous
Awtrix versions, making it easier than before to write your own apps.

Awtrix HD apps can be written either in TypeScript or JavaScript and use the
Vue framework for the frontend.

### Centralized app library

Awtrix HD uses a centralized app library. You can configure your own 3rd party
library, but if you want your app to be available on the official app library,
they will need to be open source and reviewed by one of Awtrix's maintainers.

All apps can be found in the awtrix-hd-apps repository on GitHub, which is also
the place to

### Requirements

Awtrix HD runs on node.js 10.2, so you will need to have it installed as well
in order to run it. 
Awtrix HD is built to be run on Node.js 10.2, so if possible try to install
this exact version. If you already have another version of Node.js installed,
you can use a version manager such as nvm to install multiple versions at the
same time.
